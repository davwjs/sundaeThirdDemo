As a team comprised of immigrants, LGBTQIA+, and people of color, we are committed to building an industry and community that reflects everyone, not just the lucky few. In line with our commitment to diversity and equity, we donate 1% of our sales through Beam, and work specifically with minority owned businesses - from equity-owned flower businesses in California to garment factories hiring the single-parents in Seoul. We make it a priority to partner with people and brands who reflect our ideals.",
